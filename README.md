# GOV.UK Prototype kit

## News

**Version 2.0.0 update:** the latest version of the kit (2.0.0) is not compatible with previous versions. If you update your old prototypes you'll need to [convert them as well](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit/blob/master/docs/updating-the-kit.md).

## About the prototype kit

The prototype kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on GOV.UK. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

It's built on the [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework, and uses these GOV.UK resources:

- [GOV.UK template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template)
- [GOV.UK front end toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit)
- [GOV.UK elements](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements)

Read the [project principles](docs/principles.md).
