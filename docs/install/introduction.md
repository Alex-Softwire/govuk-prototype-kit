# Introduction

The prototype kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look and feel like pages on GOV.UK. These prototypes can be used to design and lay out pages, and to use in user research.

You’ll use a copy of the kit for each different prototype you want to make - they’re self contained. Once installed, the kit uses about 100mb.

## About this guide

This guide will walk you through installing and getting started with the kit. You don’t need any technical knowledge to follow along. If you get stuck, post a message on Slack, or if you have a developer on your team, they should be able to help.

If you’re comfortable using git and the terminal, you may prefer the developer-friendly instructions.

> This guide is a work in progress. Please help [contribute](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) to make it even better.

## About the kit

The kit helps you build prototypes. It's great for getting up and running to test ideas.

The kit is not meant as a starter framework for production services. The code in this kit is not production-ready or fully accessible. It is meant for quick prototyping.

> You must protect user privacy at all times, even when using prototypes. Prototypes made with the kit look like GOV.UK, but do not have the same security provisions. Always make sure you are handling user data appropriately. 

>**DO NOT** enter real user data in to prototypes hosted online in services like Heroku. If your prototype stores or collects user data, talk to a security professional about appropriate security steps you must take.
